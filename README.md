# Techspo Website
In this project, I build a .NET core MVC web app for a free Tech Expo that will be held on the 3rd & 4th of November.

### What I used

- Azure - SQL Database and web app deployment
- Visual Studio - Programming the web app
- Figma - Designing and exporting the assets I needed for the project

### Project summary

The home and upcoming sessions pages are dynamic and change depending on the day, as you will see below. All the content displayed on the web app is integrated with the SQL database to give the web app its dynamic capability.

FOR ATTENDEES:

The web app is meant to give attendees all the relevant information regarding speakers and what time who is speaking, where and when. The goal was for attendees to visit the website and use it to lead them to the speakers they would like to listen in on, instead of waiting for their speaker to come on or asking around for assistance.

FOR POTENTIAL ATTENDEES:

The web app is also the registration point for people who want to attend the event. Potential attendees can register for the free event by picking a voucher they want, registering and downloading the ticket. When registering, their credentials are saved onto the database, in the case they forget to download their ticket, they will still be able to attend with their username and email.
